    exchange_graph(Ms::Array{KnuthMatroid}, sets::Array{Integer}, n::Integer)

Constructs an exchange graph given an m-length array Ms of matroids over the same ground set E, and an m-length array Ss of subsets of E. Each set is represented as an integer of at least n bits, where a 1-bit at bit i denotes that the set contains the element i. Each element is assumed to be in exactly one set. Each set Ss[i] corresponds to the matroid Ms[i], with which the rank can be deduced.

The exchange graph is a graph whose vertices are the elements of E, and contains the edge (i,j) iff rank_i(S_i - i + j) = rank_i(S_i), where S_i is the set that contains i and rank_i the rank function for the corresponding matroid. In other words, it contains an edge (i,j) iff i can be replaced by j with no loss in rank.

Returns the exchange graph G and a dictionary d that maps between each element of E and the set in Ss that contains it. 

NB! Whereas the elements are the set {0, ..., n-1}, the nodes in the graph make up the set {1, ..., n}. That is, vertex v represents element v-1. This is because nodes are 1-indexed in Graphs.jl.
