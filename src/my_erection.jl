    function my_random_erection(n, p, T=UInt16)

Erects a matroid in the same way that Knuth's 1974 matroid erection algorithm does, but only keeps track of the "redundant" sets, ie. the closed sets that are not independent.

n is |E|, p is the list where p[i] is the number of coarsenings (closed sets to increase by 1) at rank i+1. Sets are represented as binary numbers (ø = 0x0000, E = 0xffff when n=16).
